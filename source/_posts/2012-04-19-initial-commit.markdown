I took a week long Rails boot camp in September, 2011. After that I went back to my day job as a project manager. 

After resuming my typical cadence of meetings, backlog maintenance, managing my employees, giving updates to the directors, defining requirements and managing vendors, I promptly forgot nearly everything I had learned. 

I decided to dedicate time every day to write code. 

I paired up with my friend and colleague, [Ivan](http://ivanoats.com), who has been so generous with his time: sharing keyboard shortcuts, productivity apps, vim, rails, brew, git and all kinds of useful knowledge. I started taking notes. 

I started learning, working through problems and making it "work" but not remembering how I did it. 

I found myself in need of a place to capture it all. This is that place.
