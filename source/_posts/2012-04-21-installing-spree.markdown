I ran into some challenges with versions, gems, rails version, etc. I tracked it all and then lost my text file. D'oh. 

What I did was related to having to cd out of the directory. Also, I had to follow some instructions to install a very specific version of rails. 

'''
gem 'rails', '3.1.4'
'''
I will have to come back to this one the next time I do a spree install.
